# CatchTheLED
MSP430 based game to test hand eye coordination.

This project is a simple game developed using the Texas Instruments Microcontroller Unit, the MSP430.

‘Catch the LED’ is a fun manifestation to test the concentration ability of a person. It assists the person to increase ones focus and make the reflexes better. In this game we have to press the switch whenever the reference colour appears on any of the other 3 RGB led’s , hence the name.

 We basically aim to develop a MSP430 based project which generates random numbers using PSEUDO RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR. The random numbers were then linked to the different colours of the led and the aim of the game is to “catch” a particular colour on the reference led using a switch.
 
The project was developed under the guidance of Mr. D.V Gadre, CEDT lab in Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (now, Netaji Subhas University of Technology).
